# ANN-Churn-Rate-Keras
Problem Description: A Europe based bank has been noticing surprisingly high churn rates,i.e rate at which it's customers are closing their respective bank accounts. The bank has prepared a spreadsheet having various details of each of it's customers over the past 6 months and wants to analyse,using this dataset, why the customers are ending their association with the bank.
