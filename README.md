# ANN-Churn-Rate-Keras

## Problem Description: 

A Europe based bank has been noticing surprisingly high [churn rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate) wrt cutomers closing their respective bank accounts. The bank has prepared a spreadsheet named [Churn_Modelling.csv](https://github.com/Sayan3sarkar/ANN-Churn-Rate-Keras/blob/master/Churn_Modelling.csv) having various details of each of it's customers over the past 6 months and wants to analyse,using this dataset, why the customers are ending their association with the bank. 

We prepare an [Aritificial Neural Network(ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) using [Keras API](http://keras.io/) to predict which customers are at higher chance of leaving the bank, and present that information to the bank itself so that it can interact with those customers to find their exact reasons for leaving. The details are in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Sayan3sarkar/ANN-Churn-Rate-Keras/blob/master/Churn_Modelling.csv)
